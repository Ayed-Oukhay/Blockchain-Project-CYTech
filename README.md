## Description:
This project is a Decentralized Application (DApp) allowing users to create Pokemon NFTs then vote for their favorite one created by other users. 
Each participant will be allowed to cast a single vote for their preferred Pokemon.

## To run the frontend app:
1) Go into the /frontend folder in the terminal (cmd)
2) Run the following command `npm install`
3) Run `npm start`

## Tools:
- `SmartPy`
- `React`
- `Temple Wallet` (ERROR while implementing the code to link the project with Temple)
- `Metamask` (Trying to use a snap of the Tezos Blockchain on Metamask to connect the wallet)
### Libraries:
- `Taquito library`: allows us to interact with the smart contract deployed on the blockchain
- `Beacon Wallet`: allows us to connect and interact with whatever wallet weâ€™re using

## RQ: 
To make things more simple, the smart contract is already deployed outside the project, we then just call it and interact with it using its address and the `taquito` library.
You can find its code in ./contract

## Things to improve / Functions to be added:
- Completing the Temple Wallet connection
- Connecting the app to `IPFS (Pinata)` to store the NFTs metadata (exp image)
- Implementing the `FA2` standard instead of hard coding everything in the NFT smart contract from scratch
- Adding a time limit for voting
- Announcing that the time for voting is up
- Announcing a winner
- ...
